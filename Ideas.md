#Game Ideas

Ideas so far:
-------------

  + **Cluster Game**
  
        Cluster that explodes into lets say 20 smaller balls, 19 are red and one is yellow
        the objective is to tap on the yellow ball before it leaves the screen or before a certain 
        amount of time passes. This can get increasingly more difficult by making the balls smaller, 
        making them move faster, have more red balls, allowing them to collide and change each other's 
        trajectory etc. We can have levels, or you just need to beat your previous time things like that.
        If you play longer you can unlock an award allowing you to choose the background song or change 
        the color of the balls.

  + **Logo Game**
   
        Similar to other logo games, except it'll feature only feature video game oriented logos.
        Not exclusively game company logos. We start off showing logos of say the Horde flag from WoW
        Or logos of popular game titles like CoD, and progressively use harder logos. The incentive for 
        the user will be that he needs like to get x / y right in order to move on to the next levels. 
        We can incorporate clues too etc. much like the normal Logo Quiz I'm sure everyone played at some point.
