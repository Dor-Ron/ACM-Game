  + **Cluster Game**
  
        Cluster that explodes into lets say 20 smaller balls, 19 are red and one is yellow
        the objective is to tap on the yellow ball before it leaves the screen or before a certain 
        amount of time passes. This can get increasingly more difficult by making the balls smaller, 
        making them move faster, have more red balls, allowing them to collide and change each other's 
        trajectory etc. We can have levels, or you just need to beat your previous time things like that.
        If you play longer you can unlock an award allowing you to choose the background song or change 
        the color of the balls.
